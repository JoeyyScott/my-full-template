# My very first GitPod/Github Project

Hello there! Welcome to my first Github project.

## Description

I've built this website using Github and Gitpod for the first time as part of Code Institute's course for Full Stack Web Development.

Here is a live [link](https://joeyyscott.github.io/my-full-template/) to my project.
Here is a [link](https://github.com/JoeyyScott/my-full-template) to my GitHub repository.

## Technologies

I've used HTML5 and CSS3 to construct this project in an IDE called GitPod and learned how to commit changes and back up my code through Github.

If there was more time I would like to have added some hover effects for the cards to make them more appealing and providing a brief description of the selected language.
